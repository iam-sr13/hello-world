# hello-world
Hello GitHub.

Hey there!
They call me SR13.
I am a computer science enthusiast and code flows through my blood. Pretty scary right... but its as beautiful as art for an artist.
Coding is my art. Currently i have mastered ANSI C and Standard C++. I am going to master Java and Python now. My interests lies in A.I and philosophy of life. 

Thats all for now folks.
