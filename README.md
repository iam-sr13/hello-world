# hello-world
Hey there!

They call me SR13.
I am a computer science enthusiast and code flows through my blood. Pretty scary right... but its as beautiful as art for an artist.
Coding is my art. Besides being a passionate programmer, I am personally a philosopher, thinker and futurist as well. My interests lies in A.I. and philosophy of life. 

I want to make the best of my knowledge and skills and together we can make a better world. Thats one of the Open Source philosophies so that everyone can benefit from each others skills and interests. 

Thats all for now folks.
See ya... ;)
